# Software Development Fundamentals Presentations

This repo is the source of the presentations given during the Software Development Fundamentals Course.

Each presentation covers (or will cover) the following languages:

- General information (language agnostic)
- Arduino
- GDScript
- PHP
- Python

These presetnations are written in Markdown to integrate with Marp, which converts the Markdown into Presentations. They still render to an acceptable standard through Github, however.
